These APIs update the properties of your View objects over a period of time, continuously redrawing the view as the properties change. For example, when you change the position properties, the view moves across the screen, or when you change the alpha property, the view fades in or out. To create these animations with the least amount of effort, you can enable animations on your layout so that when you simply change the visibility of a view, an animation applies automatically.
